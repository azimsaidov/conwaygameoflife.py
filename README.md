So someone mathematician named John Conway created the game of life or really just cellular automation. 

Each square in the grid is a cell (life) and they all update simultaneously. If the grid is white it is considered "alive" and if it is black it is considered "dead."
Its life is dictated by its neighbors! Just like real life. 

A neighbor is any cell touching the main cell. 


Alive Cells
- If a cell has less then 2 neigbors it DIES from lack of reproduction oppurtunities.
- If a cell has more then 3 neigbors it DIES from overpopulation.
- Anything else its fine to stay alive.

Dead Cells
- if a cell has 3 neighbors then it is born! From basic reproduction, if you have questions ask your bio teacher.
